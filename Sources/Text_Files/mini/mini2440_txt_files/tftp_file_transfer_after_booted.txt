/ #    ---> client (target)
root # ---> Server (host)

root # vi /etc/xinetd.d/tftp
	In that we previously write some configuration, in that i've given that
	/tftpboot is the directory for i/o through tftp.

root # cd /tftpboot
root # ls

Set ip addresses as per n/w concept: Here in my case
server(HOST): 10.0.0.4
client(Target): 10.0.0.111

getting file from HOST..
The file u request must be in /tftpboot directory of HOST.
/ # tftp -g 10.0.0.4 -l file_u_wnt2_get.c

Putting file to HOST..
/ # tftp -p 10.0.0.4 -l file_u_wnt2_put.c 
It will fail. bcoz of permission issues. So for that create an empty file in host with same name 
what u intended to transfer.

root # cd /tftpboot
root # touch file_tranferring.c && chmod 0777 file_transferring.c

Now transfer:
/ # tftp -p 10.0.0.4 -l file_u_wnt2_put.c
