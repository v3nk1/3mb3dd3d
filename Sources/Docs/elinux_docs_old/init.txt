- Init is the first process started during booting, and is 
  typically assigned PID number 1. 

- Its primary role is to create processes from a script 
  stored in the file /etc/inittab file.

- It is started by the kernel, and if the kernel is unable
  to start it, a kernel panic will result. 

- All System V init scripts are stored in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or 
  /etc/init.d directory. These scripts are used to control 
  system startup and shutdown.
