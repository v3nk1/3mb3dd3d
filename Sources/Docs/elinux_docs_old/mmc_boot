ON HOST SYSTEM:
===============

 Inset MMC card into system slot

- Unmount all prevoius partions

- Create required partitions of required size using "fdisk" command or "gparted" apt-package, both are dangerous becarefull!

	# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0  (Here i am using fdisk)

	-create partitions as below:
		64M ---> for kernel
		1G  ---> for root-fiesystem

- After creating partitions check at /dev directoty then we find two device files  
	/dev/mmcblk0p1		( used for 64M kernel partition)
	/dev/mmcblk0p2 		( used for 64M rootfs partition)

- By using following command to create ext2/fat filesystem for 1st partition (ext2/fat because uboot support these two filesystems)  
	# mkfs.ext2 /dev/mmcblk0p1  (for ext2 fs) 
		
			OR

	# mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/mmcblk0p1  (for fat32 fs)

- Creating filesystem for 2nd partition (i.e for root filesystem) is our wish (i.e ext2/ext3/ext4/fat).
	Here we are using ext3 for this, by using following command
	# mkfs.ext3 /dev/mmcblk0p2

- Mount those partitions into your desired mount points by using "mount" command.
	
- Copy the kernel image into 1st parttion and copy rootfile system into 2nd partition.

- Safely unmount those partitions using "umount" command.
  

 ON TARGET SYSTEM BOOTLOADER:
=============================

- Insert mmc card into target board mmc slot

	MINI2440# mmcinit	(This command initialize the mmc)

- Set bootargs as following, Here rootfilesysyem type ext3 because as per the created filesystem type for 2nd partition in mmc
 
	MINI2440# setenv bootargs console=ttySAC0,115200 rootfstype=ext3 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2

- Copy the uImage from mmc kernel (1st) partition to RAM, by using following command
	Here 'mmc' is device name,  0:1--->means Device 0 and Partition 1

	MINI2440# ext2load mmc 0:1 0x31000000 uImage	(if we are using ext2 for ist partition)
		
				OR

	MINI2440# fatload mmc 0:1 0x31000000 uImage	(if we are using fat for ist partition)

- Start the booting using following command

	MINI2440# bootm 0x31000000 


AUTO BOOTING PROCESS FROM U-BOOT
================================

MINI2440# setenv bootcmd mmcinit \; ext2load mmc 0:1 0x31000000 uImage \; bootm 0x31000000 
MINI2440# setenv bootargs console=ttySAC0,115200 rootfstype=ext3 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2
MINI2440# saveenv
MINI2440# reset
