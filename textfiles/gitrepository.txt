	   it may thrown this error: "*** Please tell me who you are."
		# git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

	# git remote add origin https://github.com/v3nk1/<your-created-git-repo-website>
		OR
	  git remote add origin <previously-copied-to-clipboard-address>
	# git push -u origin master
		[ It will ask for username of git and password for that username for authentication]

	# git remote add origin https://github.com/v3nk1/<your-created-git-repo-website>
	# git add <file1> <file2> <file3> ..
	# git commit -m "first commit"
	# git push -u origin master

Step 6:

	# git rm <file1> <file2> <file3> ..
	# git commit -m "first commit"
	# git push -u origin master
		
Step 7:
	Dowload or sync from repository
	
	# git clone <previously-copied-to-clipboard-address>

	To get updated things from repository without download all, 
	only change or download modified things in repository
	
	# git pull

	To update things to repository without upload all,
	
	# git add .
	# git commit -m "first commit"
	# git push -u origin master
